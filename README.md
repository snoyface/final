final project write ups
My final project ideas:

1: interactive heart beat 

      -Create a heart beat on a projection mapped heart with your own heart beat.
        By using a panel or heart beat sensor (this is being researched), users can put thier hang on the sensor and will         see their heartbeat projected on a phsyical heart. Each "beat" will create an expanding color wave that will move         through-out the rest of the heart (a wave will will take about 5sec to move through whole heart. This will make           use of physical sensors, a beaglebone black, laptop, physical heart (sympbol, rather than realistic heart
        and a projector.
          -Possible additions
            1 Addtional sensors to put addtional user hands on, and have heart beat "waves" interact on heart
            2 Include screen with additional parameters to change and simple UI (change color spread, wave speed)
            3 Larger projection mapped heart
            
            
            
2: Slit Scan wall

    -Code a program that takes a live webcam data and introduce a slit scan technique onto it in real time. 
     A version of video slit scan can be seen here: https://vimeo.com/7878518. This project takes the user and transmits 
     their usually mudane physical movements into something more. The video enters the program as a standard feed, and the      time is warped to have the videos timeframe to be skewed. 
          -Possible additions
            1 Buttons that turn the skew up to down, speed up the time dilation or slow it down
            2 Ability to record and playback sections of live feed and store them on physical UI
            3 Use 3d Kinetc data and create 3d version of slit scan
