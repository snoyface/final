Tonight:

1: I would like to see if I can ultimately get the sensor to work or not. So far it has not worked, but could potentially be fixed
in the code

2: finish quartz composer patch and attach to video mapping program Resolume so I can import and use on heart shape.

For the Final:

1: (if) heart beat monitor works, then hopefully I can make the whole project work for next week in a workable format. If not, 
then at least make everything work that I can and "fake" the heartbeat and be able to show that at least.
